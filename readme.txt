Privatize parts of posts from unauthorized users. Begin protected content with [protected] and end hidden content with [/protected].

== Description ==

We often wish to provide some teaser content to visitors while keeping a part of the content reserved for registered users so that they will be lured to register on our site. This plugin helps you achieve exactly this. You will be able to mark a part of your post as private and the rest will be available to public and a login form OR a register and login will appear where your privatized content is supposed to appear. Once the user logs in they will be able to see the whole content (Great for membership sites). Now you can show off parts of your site to visitors and reserve parts for registered users.
